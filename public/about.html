  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Alen Basil Thelappilly: B.Tech CSE student by day, gaming and anime enthusiast by night.</p>
  <p>Hi, I'm Alen, a B.Tech CSE student at NITK, with a passion for code by day and a penchant for pixelated quests and
    fantastical worlds by night. I'm currently navigating the labyrinthine world of B.Tech CSE at NITK, but when I need
    a break from the code, you'll find me slaying digital dragons or unraveling the mysteries of the latest anime
    masterpiece.</p>
  <p>As part of the WEC NITK Intelligence SIG, I'm exploring the frontiers of AI.</p>
  <p>I'm also part of TedxNITKSurathkal Curation SIG, helping curate inspiring talks that spark curiosity and
    innovation.</p>
  <p>If you're down for a friendly conversation about anything tech, gaming, or anime (or all of the above!), feel free
    to hit me up! You can also check out my portfolio(which is under process) and blog(which is also under process) to
    see some of my projects and thoughts. I look forward
    to hearing from you soon!</p>
  <p>Also thank you to all the AI chatbots that helped me write this cause I could never write something as cheesy as
    this(insert skull emoji).</p>
